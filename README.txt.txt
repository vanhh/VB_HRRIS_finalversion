Assumptions:
Customer: 
	- title and gender should be appropriate to each other
	- customer must be over 16 year-old to have a profile and book a room by himself
	- phone number: 15 digits or shorter
Room:
	- rooms cannot have the same number
	- room number format: 3 digits - The first digit is the floor number
	- the highest floor : 9
	- the default number of beds for each type room: single - 1. twin - 2. suite -4 (auto added to prevent human errors)
Booking:
	- the number of guests is depend on room's type
	- customer must have a profile already in the database
